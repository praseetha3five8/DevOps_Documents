Install and configure memcached on Ubuntu
-----------------------------------------
This section provides instructions to install memcached on Ubuntu. For additional information, consult the memcached wiki.

We recommend using memcached version 3.0.5 or later.

To install and configure memcached on Ubuntu:

As a user with root privileges, enter the following command:


============================================================
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install php5-memcache memcached
Change the memcached configuration setting for CACHESIZE and -l:

Open /etc/memcached.conf in a text editor.
Locate the -m parameter.
Change its value to at least 1GB
Locate the -l parameter.
Change its value to 127.0.0.1 or localhost
Save your changes to memcached.conf and exit the text editor.
Restart memcached.

service memcached restart
Restart your web server.


For Apache, service apache2 restart

Continue with the next section.

Verify memcached works before installing Magento
We recommend testing memcached to make sure it works before you install Magento. Doing so takes only a few minutes and can simplify troubleshooting later.

Verify memcached is recognized by the web server
To verify memcached is recognized by the web server:

Create a phpinfo.php file in the web server’s docroot:

<?php

// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();
Go to that page in your web browser.

For example, http://192.0.2.1/phpinfo.php

Make sure memcached displays as follows:

Confirm memcache is recognized by the web server

Verify you’re using memcached version 3.0.5 or later.

If memcache does not display, restart the web server and refresh the browser page. If it still does not display, verify you installed the php-pecl-memcache extension.

Verify memcached can cache data
This test uses a PHP script to verify that memcached can store and retrieve cache data.

For more information about this test, see this digitalocean tutorial.

Create cache-test.php in the web server’s docroot with the following contents:

if (class_exists('Memcache')) {
    $meminstance = new Memcache();
} else {
    $meminstance = new Memcached();
}

$meminstance->addServer("<memcache hostname or ip>", <memcache port>);

$result = $meminstance->get("test");

if ($result) {
    echo $result;
} else {
    echo "No matching key found.  Refresh the browser to add it!";
    $meminstance->set("test", "Successfully retrieved the data!") or die("Couldn't save anything to memcached...");
}
where <memcache hostname or ip> is either localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the memcache hostname or IP address. <memcache port> is its listen port; by default, 11211.

Go to that page in a web browser.

For example, http://192.0.2.1/cache-test.php

The first time you go to the page, the following displays: No matching key found. Refresh the browser to add it!

Refresh the browser. The message changes to Successfully retrieved the data!

Finally, you can view the memcache keys using Telnet:

telnet localhost <memcache port>
At the prompt, enter

stats items
The result is similar to the following:

STAT items:2:number 1
STAT items:2:age 106
STAT items:2:evicted 0
STAT items:2:evicted_nonzero 0
STAT items:2:evicted_time 0
STAT items:2:outofmemory 0
STAT items:2:tailrepairs 0
STAT items:2:reclaimed 0
STAT items:2:expired_unfetched 0
STAT items:2:evicted_unfetched 0
Flush memcache storage and quit Telnet:

flush_all
quit
