Q) Challenge
Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it. For example: if num = 4, then your program should return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 24. For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer.
Sample Test Cases

Input:4

Output:24

Input:8

Output:40320




A) Sollution
def FirstFactorial(num): 

    # code goes here 
    x = 1
    for i in range(1,(num+1)):
        x = i * x
    num = x
    return num
    
# keep this function call here  
print FirstFactorial(raw_input())
